# MLA-heart-data

This project was part of a Multivariate Linear Analysis module in my 3rd year of college. 

Methods used:

- Principal Components Analysis
- Hierarchical Clustering 
- K-Means Clustering
- K-Nearest-Neighbours
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis 

The following is an outline of the assignment:

'The data set consists of nine variables, each measuring different physiological characteristics of patients at risk of heart
disease. Five variables are continuous, and three are binary. One variable, Slope, is ordinal, but for our purposes you should treat it as continuous. The tenth
variable in the data set is Class, and this denotes whether heart disease is absent (1) or present (2).
Your analysis should have two key objectives:

1. Using unsupervised learning methods, can you identify subsets of patients
in the data set who have similar physiological characteristics? Are some
subsets at higher risk of heart disease?
2. Using supervised learning methods, can you accurately predict which
patients will be diagnosed as having heart disease?'

I submitted on 14th December 2020 and achieved a First (1-1), 70%.
